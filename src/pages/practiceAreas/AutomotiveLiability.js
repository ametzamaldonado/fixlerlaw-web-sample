                <p>
                    <span className="font-weight-bold">Fixler & LaGattuta, LLP</span> has developed a vigorous, cost-effective automotive liability
                    defense practice and has had enormous success in defending cases involving all types of automobile accidents
                    from pedestrian knockdowns to multiple car crossovers. The firm's attorneys are experienced and adept in
                    defending and litigating first- and third-party PIP, PD, UM, and BI claims and have handled inter-company
                    arbitrations, coverage disputes, and first- and third-party bad faith claims.

                <h3>UIM and PIP Coverage Claims</h3>
                <p>
                    UIM and PIP are targets of personal injury lawyers and, in recent years, a ripe source of disputes between
                    insurers and insureds. We counsel and represent insurance companies in the management of these claims and
                    handle matters in the arbitration or litigation arenas when and where appropriate. We have successfully
                    defended PIP and UIM claims for both bodily injury and property damage and successfully arbitrated PIP
                    claims for medical expenses resulting from over-treatment and for unnecessary testing or surgical
                    procedures, as well as claims for lost wages.
