        <p>
            <strong>Fixler & LaGattuta, LLP</strong> has considerable experience defending insureds and their carriers in complex multi-party litigation involving labor law disputes. We have defended contractors and engineers in construction claims arising from design and construction defects including those related to roofing systems, foundation failures, tilt wall construction, highway and bridge construction, retention ponds, drainage issues, and air quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having represented general contractors, construction managers, and property developers, we have stayed at the forefront of the fast changing area of contractual indemnity and failure to procure insurance claims. We have counseled clients on appropriate contractual language for contracts and sub-contracts to best protect them from future claims, including alternative clauses as well as AIA standard contracts interpretation.
