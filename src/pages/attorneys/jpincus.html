        <p>
            Prior to joining Fixler & LaGattuta, LLP, Jonathan worked for a mid-sized civil litigation firm in New York
            representing defendants in personal injury, general liability, premises liability, motor vehicle accident,
            construction accident, and wrongful death claims. He has also defended insurance carriers in claims for
            No-Fault coverage and health care provider claims.

            During his law school career, Jonathan was an intern at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
            (“MBTA”) where he assisted the defense of MBTA’s subway and bus systems against personal injury claims. He
            also was a student prosecutor at the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office’s Appeals Unit in Atlanta
            where he argued against motions for new trials and habeas petitions, often in cases involving murder or
            other serious offenses. During his last year at law school, he participated in the Massachusetts Attorney
            General’s Office Clinic where he assisted the defense of state government entities against a wide range of
            civil litigation claims.
