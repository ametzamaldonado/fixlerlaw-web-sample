                    <p>
                        Prior to joining Fixler & LaGattuta, LLP, Jonathan worked for a mid-sized civil litigation firm in New York
                        representing defendants in personal injury, general liability, premises liability, motor vehicle accident,
                        construction accident, and wrongful death claims. He has also defended insurance carriers in claims for
                        No-Fault coverage and health care provider claims.

                        During his law school career, Jonathan was an intern at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
                        (“MBTA”) where he assisted the defense of MBTA's subway and bus systems against personal injury claims. He
                        also was a student prosecutor at the Fulton County District Attorney's Office's Appeals Unit in Atlanta
                        where he argued against motions for new trials and habeas petitions, often in cases involving murder or
                        other serious offenses. During his last year at law school, he participated in the Massachusetts Attorney
                        General's Office Clinic where he assisted the defense of state government entities against a wide range of
                        civil litigation claims.
