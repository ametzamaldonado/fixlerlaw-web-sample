                        In order to diversify, Mr. LaGattuta began working as an associate for Fixler & Associates, LLP, an
                        established insurance defense firm located in New York City and Westchester County, New York. While at F&A,
                        he continued to build on his trial experience by defending individuals and corporations in all types of
                        personal injury, malpractice, and insurance coverage matters. He obtained extensive experience in the state
                        trial and appellate courts, with emphasis on, professional liability (including medical malpractice),
                        property damage and personal injury defense litigation, primarily in the areas of automobile, premises,
                        construction, petroleum, and product liability. During his tenure at F&A, Mr. LaGattuta handled a wide

                        injury, professional liability, and insurance coverage claims. He was also instrumental in the development
                        and implementation of a transactional real estate practice at F&A, which eventually led to the creation of a
                        real estate department within this firm.
